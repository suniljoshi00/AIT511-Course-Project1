# Project Setup

## Requirements Installation
All required dependencies are automatically installed within the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) when executed.

## Data Source
The notebook loads dataset directly from GitHub raw URLs:
- Data is fetched from: raw link of data in the data folder
- No manual download required
- Ensures reproducibility with latest data

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`ml-mt2025726-mt2025704.ipynb` file)
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Dependencies will be installed automatically
4. Data will be loaded directly from GitHub

## Features
- ✅ Automatic dependency installation
- ✅ Direct data loading from GitHub
- ✅ Self-contained environment setup
- ✅ No manual configuration needed

## Note
-we made a model that had an accuracy of 97.190%
